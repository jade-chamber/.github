<h1>Jade Chamber</h1>


<p>
“The floating palace of the Tianquan Ningguang.
It once sunk into the Sea of Clouds after being used to suppress the Overlord of the Vortex, and it rose high above Liyue Harbor once more to combat other threats. Today, some people regard the Jade Chamber not only as a symbol of Ningguang's might, but also as a sign of Liyue Harbor's adamantine will.”
